# The 900n1 Gamblepack
A questionable Balatro mod, personally tweaked by yours truly.
Requires [Talisman](https://github.com/SpectralPack/Talisman) and [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods)

Adds 22 Jokers, 2 Tarots, 1 Spectral, 2 Amalgamate and Item Consumables, 5 Tags, 6 New Unique Boss Blinds (and 2 more hidden Blinds), 6 Decks (with Card Sleeves support), and much more!

Noteable Additions: Horse Race Test by Blake Andrews, Asriel Dreemurr from UNDERTALE Boss Blind, Dark Fountain from DELTARUNE Background, Algebra Blind, Tycoon Jokers, One Piece??!, Cookie Run: Kingdom Beast Cookies, Slay the Princess' Pristine Dagger, and Greed, Solitude, Fear, and Hatred from Block Tales!

Mostly centered around my fixations, this mod is supposed to be a lot bigger but I got side tracked into other thing instead and lost my motivation to work on this mod. Maybe some other day.
